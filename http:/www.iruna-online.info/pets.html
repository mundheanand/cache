1) WHAT IS PET?<br/>
Pets are used as support while soloing.<br/>
They can heal, attack, learn skills, pick up items, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Each will appear on the island. They can be fed to level up and learn skills<br/>
<br/>
2) HOW TO GET A PET<br/>
There are  3 ways to get a pet: stray pet, events, and the item shop.<br/>
<br/>
   A) STRAY PET<br/>
I think this is the easiest way or cheapest way to get a pet. <br/>
<br/>
Stray pet suddenly appear in our island based on the island items we place on our islands.<br/>
Once it appears to your island you'll have a chance to own that pet by feeding it every day or now every 8 hours. <br/>
<br/>
Feeding the stray pet will increase its affinity and if you reach a certain affinity the stray pet will be yours. <br/>
<br/>
But you need to be carefully on what to feed to the stray pet because not all food will increase its affinity. You'll need to find the right food for every kind of stray pet in your island.<br/>
<br/>
But if you can afford to buy a food called "fancy pet food" or you do production cooking to make your own. This pet food is almost good to all kind of pet in increasing its affinity therefore sure you'll get that stray pet become your own pet.<br/>
<br/>
It requires an affinity of 500 for the stray pet to be yours.<br/>
<br/>
If you get a stray you don't want on your island, you can expel it so another stray can show up. If you haven't fed it yet, simply logging in and out of your island will get rid of it. Some stray pets are more rare than others, and may take a while to show up. <br/>
<br/>
     B) PETS FROM EGG (events or item shop)<br/>
Pet eggs can be obtain either on events or buy at item shop.<br/>
<br/>
Pets from events can't learn some pet skills that a pet from item shop can learn.<br/>
(See pet skills info)<br/>
<br/>
Pets eggs are not tradedable.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the stray pets, pets from eggs not requires a certain affinity (500) before thay become your pet. Once the pet egg hatch its already your and you can name it. <br/>
<br/>
Egg pets start out as small and grow over time by feeding it, eventually reach its full size. however, the effect is only slightly noticeable.<br/>
<br/>
3) HOW YOUR PET CAN A GET SKILL ?<br/>
<br/>
After your pet reaches lvl50 with 1000 affinity it will automatically learn a random skill. If your pet is at or above Lv75, your pet can learn a skill without requiring 1,000 affinity.<br/>
<br/>
You can also learn pet skills by feeding them pet eggs.<br/>
<br/>
Skills can be randomly reset for 500 island points. You can collect island points in many ways. The skills below that have stars next to them can only be obtained if your pet is a boss or god pet (only available from the Item Shop). Skills learned are random with no known correlation to your pet's stats or what you feed it.<br/>

<br/>
Pet Synthesis <br/>
  Pet Synthesis allows pets to break the stat limit when they reach lvl 100 <br/>
<br/>
Requirements <br/>
  2 Pets at least lvl 10 <br/>
  need both to have 1k affinity to ensure success <br/>
 100 island points <br/>
<br/>
Success and Fail Synthesis <br/>
   When doing pet synthesis you will lose both pets you used and the resulting pet will take the appearance of the first pet you selected but will return to lvl 1 with 0 stats/affin/stamina and ull need to name it again. <br/>
  When synthesis fails nothing will happen but will consume 100 island points. <br/>
<br/>
Pet Skill Inheritance <br/>
  When one of your pets got a pet skill you can choose to either inherit it to the new pet or dont. In case of both pets having skills each , you can only select one of the 2 skills to be enherited by the resulting pet via synthesis. <br/>
